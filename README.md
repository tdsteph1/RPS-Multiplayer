# RPS-Multiplayer

In this assignment, you'll indeed create another Rock Paper Scissors game. The catch? You're going to make this an online multiplayer game, all with the help of Firebase (and the rest of your web development repertoire)!

Create a game that suits this user story:


* Only two users can play at the same time.
* Both players pick either rock, paper or scissors. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred * or if one player defeated the other.
* The game will track each player's wins and losses.
* Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from * your jerk opponent.
* Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
* Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.

## Bob choses Rock, Alex's(Paper) beats Bob's(Rock) therefore Alex wins and wins, loses are icremented.
